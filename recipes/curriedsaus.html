    <h2>How to make Curried Sausages</h2>
    <p>
      Retro is back, baby! At last, I can make my shameful curried sausages love
      public. As a meal, it has enough kick to know you’re alive, but it’s not
      too spicy for kids, making it an ideal midweek dinner for families – and
      it’s pretty easy on the budget too! There's a reason this curried sausages
      recipe has scored 5 stars from more than 130 people. It's absolutely
      delicious! Better yet, ingredients for curried sausages are easy to find
      in your pantry (we're looking at you, Keens curry powder), teamed with a
      handful of fresh ingredients including carrots and peas (and perhaps some
      creamy mashed potato, to serve).

        Heat oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook
        sausages, in batches, turning, for 5 to 6 minutes or until browned all
        over. Transfer to a large plate.

        Add onion, carrot and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until
        onion has softened. Add curry powder. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or
        until fragrant. Add fruit chutney and stock. Return sausages to pan.
        Cover, bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered,
